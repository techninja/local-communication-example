SparkCore Serial Socket
===========================
A serial pass through proof of concept for fast wireless communication between
a server, the spark core, and a serial device. Allows for full duplex serial
communication through the socket.

Copy firmware.cpp into a new app in [Spark build](https://www.spark.io/build).

Run the local server `node simple_server.js`, then follow its instructions.
